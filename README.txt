Drag-and-drop, words to sentences question type

This question type requires that gapselect question type
https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-qtype_gapselect/
to be installed in order to work.

This question type was originally the work of Mahmoud Kassaei at
the Open University (http://www.open.ac.uk/).
It was updated to work with the Moodle 2.1 question engine by Tim Hunt.
It was then refactored extenstively by Jamie Pratt (http://jamiep.org/)
as part of creating the gapselect question type.
